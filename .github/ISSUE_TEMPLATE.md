Hello :) Before you create an issue please read the following message:

My name is Roman and I'm the only developer of this app.

I will NOT contribute any more code to this repository ever again. 

This repository is mostly for sharing the knowledge I gained during development.

At the moment I dedicate all my time to a startup and working on a new and very modern update to eqMac.

This new update will be completely rewritten from scratch and have many more new features and will be massively more stable (at least that't the plan).

I plan to release the new version in Q3 of 2018. 

Thank you for your patience and giving eqMac a go :)

GitHub is only for source-code related issues.

Still would like to report a bug or suggest a feature I can implement in the next version?
